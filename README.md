# About Litfair

This project is an AI-powered platform that enhances the recruiting process by providing solutions to job seekers and the hiring teams.

The platform provides a faster, friendlier, and more stable recruiting experience with the help of automated CV Screening and video interviewing software that uses a powerful AI to pre-screen and shortlist candidates, bringing the best talents out there for the role you’re looking for. Which cuts the time of unnecessary pre-interviews, giving you more time to focus on what’s really important.
